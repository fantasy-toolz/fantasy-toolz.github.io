// I am working on a webpage that will display mlb lineups as a table (columns are date and hitters 1-9; rows are different dates). I have all the information for each team in a separate csv, to be loaded from a url. I'd like to have a dropdown menu that lets the user select which team, and then have the csv data displayed as a table. Can you make the html, js, and a simple css file to do this?
