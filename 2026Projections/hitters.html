    <h3>2026 Hitter Predictions, Version February 17th, 2026</h3>
    <p>Go to: <a href='pitchers.html'>Pitchers</a> <!--<a href='index.html'>Overall</a>--> </p>

    <p>These are our best estimates for the 2026 hitter projections. The confidence score ranges from 0 (low confidence) to 100 (high confidence), based on processing our statistically-meaningful-but-not-helpful uncertainties. The uncertainties themselves can be found on our GitHub page.</p>

    <!--<p> Key: PA=plate appearances, AVG = batting average, lAVG/hAVG = low/high projections for batting average, HR= home runs, lHR/hHR=low/high projections for home runs, R= runs, lR/hR= low/high projections for runs, RBI=runs batted in, lRBI/hRBI = low/high forecase for runs batted in, SB=stolen bases, lSB/hSB=low/high projections for stolen bases, Rank=overall ROTO ranking.</p>-->

    <!--<p> We now forecast a 'low' and 'high' ranking for each stat instead of a single uncertainty band. Outcomes are for 20-80 per cent outcomes.</p>-->

    <p> PAs are an aggregate of all predictions systems available on FantasyPros (thank you!).</p>
