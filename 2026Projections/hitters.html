<h3>2025 Hitter Predictions, Version February 11th, 2026</h3>
<p>Go to: <a href='pitchers.html'>Pitchers</a> <!--<a href='index.html'>Overall</a>--> </p>

<p> Key: PA=plate appearances, AVG = batting average, lAVG/hAVG = low/high projections for batting average, HR= home runs, lHR/hHR=low/high projections for home runs, R= runs, lR/hR= low/high projections for runs, RBI=runs batted in, lRBI/hRBI = low/high forecase for runs batted in, SB=stolen bases, lSB/hSB=low/high projections for stolen bases, Rank=overall ROTO ranking.</p>

<p> We now forecast a 'low' and 'high' ranking for each stat instead of a single uncertainty band. Outcomes are for 20-80 per cent outcomes.</p>

<p> PAs are an aggregate of all predictions systems available on FantasyPros (thank you!).</p>
