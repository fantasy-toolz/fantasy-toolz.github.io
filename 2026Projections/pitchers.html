    <h3>2026 Pitcher Predictions, Version March 1st, 2026</h3>
    <p>Go to: <a href='hitters.html'>Batters</a> <a href='../index.html'>Homepage</a><!-- <a href='index.html'>Overall</a> --></p>

    <!--<p> Key: IP=innings pitched, SO = strikeouts, eSO = uncertainty in strikeouts, ERA= earned run average, eERA=uncertainty in earned run average, WHIP= walks+hits per inning pitched, eWHIP= uncertainty in walks+hits per inning pitched, W=wins, eW = uncertainty in wins, S=saves, eS=uncertainty in saves, TBF=total batters faced, Rank=overall ranking.</p>-->

    <p>These are our best predictions for the 2026 pitcher projections. The confidence score ranges from 0 (low confidence) to 100 (high confidence), based on processing our statistically-meaningful-but-not-helpful uncertainties. The uncertainties themselves can be found on our GitHub page.</p>

    <p> This now features borrowed IPs aggregated from Fantasy Pros, Wins model v1.9, and (still) Saves model v1.0.2023. </p>
