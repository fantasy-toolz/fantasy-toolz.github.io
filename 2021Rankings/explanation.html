<h2>How the rankings work</h2>

<p> The guiding principle is to use the data from previous years to guide the projections for the current year. We operate on normalised rates, i.e. the probability of a given outcome for each plate appearance, \(P( \{H,R,RBI,HR,SB\} | PA)\) for batters and a given outcome per inning pitched, \(P( \{H,BB,SO,W,S\} | IP)\) for pitchers. We start from the assumption that all players fit into a handful of archetypes that broadly define their statistical outputs: home run hitters, contact hitters, stolen base specialists, fireballers, junk pitchers, etc. But instead of defining the players ourselves, we let the data determine the archetypes.</p>

<!-- *************************************** -->
<h3> 1. Player classification </h3>

<p>We use a k-means clustering algorithm to determine player archetypes in order to classify players in broad categories.</p>

<p>Example. distribution in R vs. RBI space. </p>

<h4> Criteria for assignment </h4>
<p>Batters must have more than 100 PA in a season for the cluster to be assigned. </p>

<h4> Number of clusters </h4>
<p>We perform a cluster stability analysis by increasing the number of clusters until new clusters are only opened in uninteresting locations of parameter space (e.g. very good or very bad). </p>

<!-- *************************************** -->
<h3> Player predictions </h3>
<p>Parameters to be set. Weights for previous years: \(\omega_{1,\ldots,n}\). Regression factor to archetypes: \(\alpha\). </p>

<p>The primary product we provide is a most-probable rate for each cluster statistic. Every players starts as a weighted mean of the centroids of each cluster they have been assigned to, which is then modified for the particular player. As each player has a rate that does not match the centroid, we adjust the estimate based on the distance from the center of the cluster. </p>

<h4> Assigning weights per year </h4>

<p>One needs to decide how to mix the contributions from previous years. We select weights to define contribution to the predictions from each year. The simplest assumption is that every year counts the same. However, players change from year to year, and are more likely to resemble their recent years rather than historical seasons. The subscript denotes the year relative to the current year: \(\omega_{current\ year - previous\ year}\). For batters, we choose \(\omega_{1}=0.50,\ \omega_{2}=0.30,\ \omega_{2}=0.13,\ \omega_{4}=0.07\). Assigning weights for each year is currently a dark art, and we should think of a verification procedure. </p>

<p> Example. The year is 2021. If we had chosen \(\omega_{1}=0.5\) and \(\omega_{2}=0.5\), 50% of the inference for 2021 comes from the previous year (2020) and 50% of the inference for 2021 comes from the year before that (2019). </p>

<p> For pitchers, we use \(\omega_{1}=0.45,\ \omega_{2}=0.30,\ \omega_{2}=0.15,\ \omega_{4}=0.10\). </p>

<h4> Assigning the 'stickiness' of the clusters </h4>
<p> Each player's rates for a given year are regressed back toward the center of the cluster by a chosen factor \(\alpha\). Choosing the regression factor is not well-determined. </p>

<p> Example. Anthony Rendon is assigned to a 2019 cluster with \(\langle R\rangle=0.12\). In 2019, Rendon actually achieved \(R=0.14\). With an assigned regression factor of \(\alpha=0.5\), Rendon's true predicted 2019 was \(\langle R\rangle+\alpha\cdot (R-\langle R\rangle) = (1-\alpha)\cdot \langle R\rangle + \alpha\cdot R = 0.13\). This number is used in the weighted average. </p>

<!-- *************************************** -->
<h3> Uncertainty bands </h3>

<p> Given how far the individual point is from the center of a cluster, we make estimates for the band of likely statistical outcomes given membership in a cluster.</p>

<p> The key assumption is that each player's uncertainty must include the centroid of the cluster to which they have been assigned. </p>

<h4> Centroid regression factors in uncertainty </h4>
<p>The factor used to regress each year back to the mean is also tuned to create uncertainty estimates. </p>
